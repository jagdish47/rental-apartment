# React App Starter

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```

   Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username and `your-repo` with the name of your repository.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd your-repo
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This command will download and install all the required dependencies for the project.

4. **Start the Development Server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The development server will start, and your default web browser will open the app at `http://localhost:3000/`.
